# Simple url encoder function
#
# Implement same basic semantics as Python's urllib.parse.quote() function:
#
# > Letters, digits, and the characters '_.-~' are never quoted. By default,
# > this function is intended for quoting the path section of a URL.
#
# This means encode everything except unreserved characters from RFC3986
# *or* slash (/).

emulate -L zsh

setopt EXTENDED_GLOB

# Set by backreference glob (#b), and since they get set for each character to
# encode, option WARN_NESTED_VAR will complain loudly if they're not declared local.

# Split input into an array of single characters
local input=(${(s::)1})
print ${(j::)input/(#b)([^A-Za-z0-9_.~\-\/])/%${(l:2::0:)$(([##16]#match))}}
