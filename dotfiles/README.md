# Configuration files etc. for MiSTer shell

I've created a persistent faux-HOME for root in `/media/fat/rhome`. Anything
that doesn't survive a system OS update is handled by
[after-update/runme](after-update/runme) script.

These are not intended to be used as-is by anyone else. You're free to adopt
anything interesting you might find, but make sure you understand thoroughly
what you're doing and why.
